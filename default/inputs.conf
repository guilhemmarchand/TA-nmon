# In json format, you can as well choose between 2 pre-configured sourcetypes:
# - "sourcetype = nmon_data:json:extracted" and "source = perfdata:json:extracted": Index the json data as raw data and extract the fields at search time, this saves storage at the price of lower performances
# - "sourcetype = nmon_data:json:indexed" and "source = perfdata:json:indexed": Index the json data as json indexed, best performances at the cost of more storage requirements

# Activating the json generation occurs in the props.conf level (create a local/props.conf and include the --json_output argument in data parsing)

#		    nmon cleaner
####################################################

# NEW with v1.5.0: A cleaner script is provided in Python and Perl to manage the cleaning of
# Nmon raw data files and csv perf and config files
# In normal circumstances, there should never be any csv files in csv_respository and config_repository, this action is off by default
# and unless you ask it, cleaner scripts won't do anything in these directories
# But if you want to prevent from running out of file handle or abnormal CPU usage in case of unexpected situation (eg. batch mode not working for example)
# you can use the "--cleancsv" switch (see the full help above)

# By default and without any option provided, cleaner scripts (nmon_cleaner.py and nmon_cleaner.pl) will:
# - Search for nmon files (*.nmon) in default nmon_repository and remove any file older than 24 hours

# Available options are:
# --cleancsv :Activate the purge of files from csv repository, json_repository and config repository (see also options above)
# --maxseconds_csv <value> :Set the maximum file retention in seconds for csv data, every files older than this value will be permanently removed
# --maxseconds_nmon <value> :Set the maximum file retention in seconds for nmon files, every files older than this value will be permanently removed
# --approot <value> :Set a custom value for the Application root directory (default are: nmon / TA-nmon / PA-nmon)
# --csv_repository <value> :Set a custom location for directory containing csv data (default: csv_repository)
# --config_repository <value> :Set a custom location for directory containing config data (default: config_repository)
# --nmon_repository <value> :Set a custom location for directory containing nmon raw data (default: nmon_repository)
# --version :Show current program version

# NOTE: When managing larget set of cold Nmon data generated out of Splunk, it is recommended to set an higher custom value for csv max retention
# The default value is 4 hours (3h and 59 minutes, so 14320 seconds actually), in case of high load of Splunk, this can lead to delete data before it is being indexed.

# NEW since Version 1.5.07, a frontal simple shell script is used to encapsulate both Python and Perl script
# If Python is not locally available, the Perl version will be automatically used
