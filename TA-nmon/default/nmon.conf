################################
# Nmon processes related options
################################

#
# These options will be used to manage Nmon processes starting options
#

# This configuration file will set the interval and snapshot values when starting up the nmon binary
# It is being sourced by the nmon_helper.sh script during script startup

# *** BE UPGRADE RESILIENT: *** Copy this file to your local/nmon.conf to prevent future upgrades from overwriting your settings
# *** DON'T MODIFY THIS FILE ***

# *** FILE ENCODING: UTF-8 ! ***
# When creating a local/nmon.conf, pay attention to file encoding specially when working under Windows.
# The file must be UTF-8 encoded or you may run in trouble.

### NMON COLLECT OPTIONS ###

# The nmon_helper.sh input script is set by default to run every 60 seconds
# If Nmon is not running, the script will start Nmon using the configuration above

###
### Legacy options for nmon writing to regular files (these values are used by the TA-nmon not using fifo files)
###

# The "longperiod_high" mode is a good compromise between accuracy, CPU / licensing cost and operational intelligence, and can be used in most case
# Reducing CPU foot print can be achieved using one of the following modes, increasing the interval value and limiting the snapshot value are the factors that will impact the TA footprint
# If you observe a too large CPU foot print on your servers, please choose a different mode, or a custom mode

# Available modes for proposal below:

#	shortperiod_low)
#			interval="60"
#			snapshot="10"

#	shortperiod_middle)
#			interval="30"
#			snapshot="20"

#	shortperiod_high)
#			interval="20"
#			snapshot="30"

#	longperiod_low)
#			interval="240"
#			snapshot="120"

#	longperiod_middle)
#			interval="120"
#			snapshot="120"

#	longperiod_high)
#			interval="60"
#			snapshot="120"

# custom --> Set a custom interval and snapshot value, if unset short default values will be used (see custom_interval and custom_snapshot)

# Default is longperiod_high
mode="longperiod_high"

# Refresh interval in seconds, Nmon will use this value to refresh data each X seconds
# UNUSED IF NOT SET TO custom MODE
custom_interval="60"

# Number of Data refresh occurrences, Nmon will refresh data X times
# UNUSED IF NOT SET TO custom MODE
custom_snapshot="120"

###
### FIFO options: used since release 1.3.0
###

# Using FIFO files (named pipe) are now used to minimize the CPU footprint of the technical addons
# As such, it is not required anymore to use short cycle of Nmon run to reduce the CPU usage

# You can still want to manage the volume of data to be generated by managing the interval and snapshot values
# as a best practice recommendation, the time to live of nmon processes writing to FIFO should be 24 hours

# value for interval: time in seconds between 2 performance measures
fifo_interval="60"

# value for snapshot: number of measure to perform
fifo_snapshot="1440"

### VARIOUS COMMON OPTIONS ###

# Time in seconds of margin before running a new iteration of Nmon process to prevent data gaps between 2 iterations of Nmon
# the nmon_helper.sh script will spawn a new Nmon process when the age in seconds of the current process gets higher than this value

# The endtime is evaluated the following way: 
# endtime=$(( ${interval} * ${snapshot} - ${endtime_margin} ))

# When the endtime gets higher than the endtime_margin, a new Nmon process will be spawned
# default value to 240 seconds which will start a new process 4 minutes before the current process ends

# Setting this value to "0" will totally disable this feature

endtime_margin="240"

### NFS OPTIONS ###

# Change to "1" to activate NFS V2 / V3 (option -N) for AIX hosts
AIX_NFS23="0"

# Change to "1" to activate NFS V4 (option -NN) for AIX hosts
AIX_NFS4="0"

# Change to "1" to activate NFS V2 / V3 / V4 (option -N) for Linux hosts
# Note: Some versions of Nmon introduced a bug that makes Nmon to core when activating NFS, ensure your version is not outdated
Linux_NFS="0"

### LINUX OPTIONS ###

# Change the priority applied while looking at nmon binary
# by default, the nmon_helper.sh script will use any nmon binary found in PATH
# Set to "1" to give the priority to embedded nmon binaries
# Note: Since release 1.6.07, priority is given by default to embedded binaries
Linux_embedded_nmon_priority="1"

# Change the limit for processes and disks capture of nmon for Linux
# In default configuration, nmon will capture most of the process table by capturing main consuming processes
# This function is percentage limit of CPU time, with a default limit of 0.01
# Changing this value can influence the volume of data to be generated, and the associated CPU overhead for that data to be parsed

# Possible values are:
# Linux_unlimited_capture="0" --> Default nmon behavior, capture main processes (no -I option)
# Linux_unlimited_capture="-1" --> Set the capture mode to unlimited (-I -1)
# Linux_unlimited_capture="x.xx" --> Set the percentage limit to a custom value, ex: "0.01" will set "-I 0.01"
Linux_unlimited_capture="0"

# Set the maximum number of devices collected by Nmon, default is set to 1500 devices
# This option will be ignored if you set the Linux_unlimited_capturation below.
# Increase this value if you have systems with more devices
# Up to 3000 devices will be taken in charge by the Application (hard limit in nmon2csv.py / nmon2csv.pl)
Linux_devices="1500"

# Enable disks extended statistics (DG*)
# Default is true, which activates and generates DG statistics
Linux_disk_dg_enable="1"

# Name of the User Defined Disk Groups file, "auto" generates this for you
Linux_disk_dg_group="auto"

### SOLARIS OPTIONS ###

# Change to "1" to activate VxVM volumes IO statistics
Solaris_VxVM="0"

# UARG collection (new in Version 1.11), Change to "0" to deactivate, "1" to activate (default is activate)
Solaris_UARG="1"

### AIX COMMON OPTIONS ###

# CAUTION: Since release 1.3.0, we use fifo files, which requires the option "-yoverwrite=1"

# Change this line if you add or remove common options for AIX, do not change NFS options here (see NFS options)
# the -p option is mandatory as it is used at launch time to save instance pid
AIX_options="-T -A -d -K -L -M -P -^ -p -yoverwrite=1"

# enable this line if you want to get only active disks
# AIX_options=""-T -A -d -K -L -M -P -^ -p -k `lspv|grep active|awk '{print $1","}'|tr -d '\040\011\012\015'` -yoverwrite=1"

#############################
# Application related options
#############################

#
# These options are not directly related to nmon processes but to general features of the technical add-on
#

# This option can be used to force the technical add-on to use the Splunk configured value of the server hostname
# If for some reason, you need to use the Splunk host value instead of the system real hostname value, set this value to "1"

# We will search for the value of host=<value> in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/inputs.conf
# If no value can be found, or if the file does not exist, we will fallback to the normal behavior

# Default is use system hostname

# FQDN management in nmon2csv.pl/nmon2csv.py: The --fqdn option is not compatible with the host name override, if the override_sys_hostname
# is activated, the --fqdn argument will have no effect

override_sys_hostname="0"

# nmon external generation management

# This option will manage the activation or deactivation of the nmon external data generation at the lower level, before it comes to parsers
# default is activated (value=1), set to "0" to deactivate

nmon_external_generation="1"

# Fifo options

# This option will deactivate the auto switch to fifo mode, in other words the TA-nmon will use the file mode and the old mechanism
# unless you encounter unexpected issues, you should not switch to the old mechanism as the foot print is much higher

# Default is "1" which means write to fifo

mode_fifo="1"

# Since the release 1.3.0, AIX and Linux OS use the fifo_consumer.sh script to consume data produced by the fifo readers
# the following option allows specifying the options sent to the nmon2csv parsers

# consult the documentation to get the full list of available options

# --mode realtime --> explicitly manage realtime data (default)
# --use_fqdn --> use the host fully qualified domain name
# --json_output --> generate the performance data in json format instead of regular csv data

nmon2csv_options="--mode realtime"
