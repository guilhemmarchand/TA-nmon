Deploying the TA-nmon is very straightforward, basically it is just about extracting the TA-nmon tgz archive and restart Splunk.

**However, Splunk is an highly distributable solution and some good practices have to be respected, please consult the Nmon Performance core documentation:**

* Standalone deployment: http://nmon-for-splunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_standalone.html

* Distributed deployment: http://nmon-for-splunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_distributed.html

* Splunk Cloud deployment: http://nmon-for-splunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_splunkcloud.html
